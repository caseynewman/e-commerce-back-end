# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This project was created to conveniently store inventory data for an online store. The user can get information about all categories, all products, or all tags. They can also get information about a single category, product, or tag. The user can create or delete a category, product, or tag, and it will be added to or removed from the database, respectively. They can also update information about a category, product, or tag, and it will reflect on the database.

In building this project, I gained a better understanding of how the server and routes files work together. I also learned how to create a put request and run a seed file. I got much more comfortable working with the database, and I have a much better grasp on associations.

## Installation

To initially set up the project, the user will install express, dotenv, sequelize, and pg from the integrated terminal. After creating their database, they will run the 'npm run seed' command to seed their database. To start the server, the user will run 'node server' in the integrated terminal.

## Usage

From Insomnia, the user can use the get requests to find information about all categories, product, or tags, as well as information about a single category, product, or tag. They can select a post route to create a new category, product, or tag. The update routes will update information about a specific category, product, or tag, and the delete routes will remove a specific category, product, or tag. The changes will be stored in the database.
